# Kafka Local Lab

This project sets up a reproducible local Apache Kafka environment using Docker
and explores producer behavior, topic partitioning, and real-world configuration
differences compared to managed tutorial playgrounds.

Unlike educational sandboxes that auto-provision topics and partitions,
this lab reflects production-like behavior where topic metadata must be
explicitly created and managed.

## Key Learning Goals

- Run Kafka locally using Docker and KRaft mode
- Understand topic metadata and partition configuration
- Observe producer partitioning behavior with and without message keys
- Compare tutorial playground environments vs real Kafka deployments
